## Group by month

Suppose you want to group by each month(column created), this trick allows you to do just that

```select unix_timestamp(concat(substr(from_unixtime(created), 1, 7), '-01')) as g, count(*) from Members group by g order by g asc;```

Group by day
```select substr(from_unixtime(created), 1, 10) as g, sum(amount) from Transactions where pay123id != '' and type = 4 and status = 1 group by g order by g desc;```
